# ML-Algorithm_-Continue-


A machine learning algorithm is the method by which the AI system conducts its task, generally predicting output values from given input data. The two main processes of machine learning algorithms are classification and regression.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms are broadly categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. Supervised learning algorithms have both input data and desired output data provided for them through labeling, while unsupervised algorithms work with data that is neither classified nor labeled. An unsupervised algorithm might, for example, group unsorted data according to similarities and differences.Reinforcement learning, sometimes considered a fourth category, is based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones to direct unsupervised machine learning through rewards and penalties.

# Basic Concepts in Machine Learning
Machine Learning is continuously growing in the IT world and gaining strength in different business sectors. Although Machine Learning is in the developing phase, it is popular among all technologies. It is a field of study that makes computers capable of automatically learning and improving from experience. Hence, Machine Learning focuses on the strength of computer programs with the help of collecting data from various observations. In this article, ''Concepts in Machine Learning'', we will discuss a few basic concepts used in Machine Learning such as what is Machine Learning, technologies and algorithms used in Machine Learning, Applications and example of Machine Learning, and much more. So, let's start with a quick introduction to machine learning.

# What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is defined as a technology that is used to train machines to perform various actions such as predictions, recommendations, estimations, etc., based on historical data or past experience.

Machine Learning enables computers to behave like human beings by training them with the help of past experience and predicted data.

There are three key aspects of Machine Learning, which are as follows:


## Task:
A task is defined as the main problem in which we are interested. This task/problem can be related to the predictions and recommendations and estimations, etc.

## Experience:
It is defined as learning from historical or past data and used to estimate and resolve future tasks.

## Performance:
It is defined as the capacity of any machine to resolve any machine learning task or problem and provide the best outcome for the same. However, performance is dependent on the type of machine learning problems.
Techniques in Machine Learning
Machine Learning techniques are divided mainly into the following 4 categories:

# 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is applicable when a machine has sample data, i.e., input as well as output data with correct labels. Correct labels are used to check the correctness of the model using some labels and tags. Supervised learning technique helps us to predict future events with the help of past experience and labeled examples. Initially, it analyses the known training dataset, and later it introduces an inferred function that makes predictions about output values. Further, it also predicts errors during this entire learning process and also corrects those errors through algorithms.

Example: Let's assume we have a set of images tagged as ''dog''. A machine learning algorithm is trained with these dog images so it can easily distinguish whether an image is a dog or not.

# 2. Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, a machine is trained with some input samples or labels only, while output is not known. The training information is neither classified nor labeled; hence, a machine may not always provide correct output compared to supervised learning.

Although Unsupervised learning is less common in practical business settings, it helps in exploring the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.

Example: Let's assume a machine is trained with some set of documents having different categories (Type A, B, and C), and we have to organize them into appropriate groups. Because the machine is provided only with input samples or without output, so, it can organize these datasets into type A, type B, and type C categories, but it is not necessary whether it is organized correctly or not.

# 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based machine learning technique. In such type of learning, agents (computer programs) need to explore the environment, perform actions, and on the basis of their actions, they get rewards as feedback. For each good action, they get a positive reward, and for each bad action, they get a negative reward. The goal of a Reinforcement learning agent is to maximize the positive rewards. Since there is no labeled data, the agent is bound to learn by its experience only.

# 4. Semi-supervised Learning
Semi-supervised Learning is an intermediate technique of both supervised and unsupervised learning. It performs actions on datasets having few labels as well as unlabeled data. However, it generally contains unlabeled data. Hence, it also reduces the cost of the machine learning model as labels are costly, but for corporate purposes, it may have few labels. Further, it also increases the accuracy and performance of the machine learning model.
