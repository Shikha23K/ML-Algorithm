A machine learning algorithm is the method by which the AI system conducts its task, generally predicting output values from given input data. The two main processes of machine learning algorithms are classification and regression.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms are broadly categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. Supervised learning algorithms have both input data and desired output data provided for them through labeling, while unsupervised algorithms work with data that is neither classified nor labeled. An unsupervised algorithm might, for example, group unsorted data according to similarities and differences.Reinforcement learning, sometimes considered a fourth category, is based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones to direct unsupervised machine learning through rewards and penalties.
